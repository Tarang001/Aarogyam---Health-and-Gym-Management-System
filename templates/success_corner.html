                        <p class="story-excerpt">At 58 years old, David Park never imagined he'd become a fitness inspiration. As a retired accountant who had spent four decades behind a desk, his only exercise was occasional weekend golf.</p>
                        <div class="hidden-content">
                            <p>With developing Type 2 diabetes, chronic back pain, and carrying 245 pounds on his 5'8" frame, David's doctor gave him a stark warning during his annual checkup: "Make changes now, or you might not see your grandchildren grow up."
                              That wake-up call in 2021 sparked something in David. Despite feeling completely out of place in the gym and embarrassed about not even knowing how to use basic equipment, he took the first step by hiring a personal trainer who specialized in working with older adults.
                              "I could barely do a bodyweight squat when I started," David recalls with a laugh. "My trainer had me start with basic movements - walking on the treadmill, light dumbbell exercises, and lots of mobility work. The first month was humbling, but having someone guide me made all the difference."</p>
